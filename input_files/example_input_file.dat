# EXAMPLE INPUT FILE
# ------------------
#
# Example input file used to obtain the limb-darkening coefficients for
# a star with Teff = 5500 K, logg = 4.5, M/H = 0.0, vturb = 2 km/s 
# with the Kepler HIRES response function (RF = KpHiRes), the fitting method 
# of Claret & Bloemen (2011; a.k.a. CB11, FT = A100, P100) and were all the 
# bandpass is used (min_w = -1, max_w = -1) using both ATLAS and PHOENIX models
